# jsonl-file-Transforming-to-txt-metadata-deletion-and-processing-
In the code below I read 5 datasets of json-line format; I turned them into text file and applied NLTK to processing the text including separating the vocabularies, make a set of vocabularies and punctuation deletion.
Result folder is the basic dataset while the metadata was deleted including more than 4 million words.
words-set data is the set of words extracted from the Result data.
train0 is the first dataset out of 5; other 4 files will be added as my paper get accepted.
